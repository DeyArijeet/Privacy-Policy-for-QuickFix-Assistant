# Privacy Policy for QuickFix Assistant

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026

QuickFix Assistant ("we", "our", or "us") provides an educational utility application designed to help users troubleshoot and solve common smartphone issues manually. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information in connection with our mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
We believe in a **local-first** approach to privacy. 

*   **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical location.
*   **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account to use the application, and we do not track individual user identities.

## 2. Device Monitoring & Local Data
QuickFix Assistant monitors certain device health parameters to provide you with proactive alerts.

*   **Health Parameters:** The app reads current Battery levels, available Internal Storage space, and Screen Brightness settings using standard Android APIs.
*   **Processing:** All analysis of this data is performed **locally on your device**. None of this information is uploaded to our servers or shared with any third party.
*   **Fix History:** Any records of issues you have marked as "Fixed" or "Not Fixed" are stored in a private local database on your device.

## 3. Permissions
The application requests the following permissions to function correctly:

*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):** Required on Android 13+ to alert you when a system issue (like low battery or full storage) is detected by our background monitor.
*   **Internet Access:** Used for basic app functionality, such as potential documentation updates or the display of advertisements.
*   **System Settings:** The app allows you to open relevant system settings menus. We do **not** modify your system settings automatically; all changes are made by you, the user.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party service providers to help manage or monetize the app:
*   **Google Play Services:** Used for core app functionality and security.
*   **AdMob (Google):** We may display advertisements. These providers may use device identifiers (like the Android Advertising ID) to serve personalized ads. You can reset these identifiers in your device's Google settings.

## 5. Background Monitoring
QuickFix Assistant utilizes a background service (**WorkManager**) to check device health periodically. This service is designed to be lightweight and battery-efficient. It does **not** perform any "cleaning," "boosting," or unauthorized system modifications.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us immediately.

## 7. Data Deletion
Since all user data (such as fix history) is stored locally, you can permanently delete all information associated with the app at any time by:
1.  Opening your device **Settings**.
2.  Navigating to **Apps** > **QuickFix Assistant**.
3.  Selecting **Storage** and tapping **Clear Data**.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.
